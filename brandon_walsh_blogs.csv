Data Description and Collection,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/data-description-and-collection/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I’m realizing that if I don’t start combining things I will only ever blog about my class, so here I’m collecting notes on the last two weeks of “Data for the Rest of Us” on data description and collection into a single post. We got into the first real technical skills for the course as the students built out their understanding of the data production pipeline. The goal is for them to build datasets based around their own interests, and we took some real steps in that direction with these units.We had previously developed aworking definition of data, so we began our session on description by reviewing it briefly before quickly introducing metadata. We focused on its use: confusingly, metadata is often called data about data, but it’s more accurately thought of as data attached to other data that gives context, facilitates discovery, and enables analysis. We got to these topics by way of metadata in everyday life. We talked about the metadata categories used...",2025-02-10T00:00:00-05:00,1048
Poster Abstract and Code Camp,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/poster-abstract-and-code-camp/,"It’s been a tad quiet on the blog front over the past couple weeks. Here is what the Praxis squad has been up to.It’s been a great week for collaborative writing. We put together a poster abstract forDH 2013that crystallized a lot of our thoughts onPrismand crowdsourcing thus far. Perhaps we will see some of our loyal readers there? The poster abstract that we put together discusses crowdsourcing as a continuum from more mechanical interaction to forms that maintain more of a sense of the autonomous individual. We concluded by conceiving of a few different types of interfaces for Prism and the ways in which they might affect the nature of the crowdsourcing process. Much of the abstract was put together with multiple people writing different parts of the document at the same time, which I thought was an interesting enactment of the sorts of questions and issues that we have been working through.It was great to see each person’s piece combined into the whole.Special shout-out toGwenfor t...",2012-11-14T10:09:01-05:00,532

Hello World,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/hello-world/,"For some time now I have led a double life as a musician and book lover. As a third year PhD in the English department at UVA, I work primarily on twentieth-century fiction in relation to music and sound. These interests drew me toPraxisin the first place: writing about sound is incredibly difficult in a print medium where the reader can’t hear what I describe. I am very excited to be a part of the Praxis team this year, where as a DH novitiate I hope to learn how technology can help make those two fields work together more easily. The Scholars’ Lab team seems happy to have us as well, welcoming the new team with open arms and inscrutable computer science jokes.

Open Learning Together,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/open-learning-together/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.The following is a short, internal lightning talk I gave to UVA Library staff as a part of the Library’s Open Access Week in fall 2024.Hello! My name is Brandon Walsh, and I’m Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, one of the twin branches of the UVA Library’s Digital Humanities Center. I was asked to talk a bit about my work in open pedagogy as it intersects with digital humanities, a big baggy field in which we’re constantly confronting what we don’t know and helping others to do the same. From my earliest days working in DH, way back when I was a student myself in the Lab and in the Library, I was drawn to this pedagogical through line. The sheer importance of learning to it all. And this, in turn, has deeply informed how I approach Open with my students.Always learning. Always teaching.Together.My practice of open digital pedagogy is informed by three intertwining principles:Humanities students see themselves as imposters more often than not, pa...",2024-10-28T00:00:00-04:00,686
DH Is Teaching,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/dh-is-teaching/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.DH is teaching.End of talk. Can you imagine? A whole talk that is less than five words long.That’s about the point when my cat bit me to wake me up. He’s been getting me up egregiously early lately, and I jotted down some notes about the dream as I waited for him to finish eating so I could go back to sleep.1I was giving a conference talk, and Jennifer Guiliano had introduced me by giving me a bag of onions.2There were shades of the time when a classmate told our Joyce professor he would be submitting a copy ofUlyssesfor the final exam.DH is teaching.What more need be said?I’ve often said the phrase around the Lab but never thought to write it down publicly. Perhaps I thought such a thing would make me sound too much like a true believer. Or that it was so obvious a statement as to render it meaningless.

Workshop On Reading With Command Line,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/workshop-on-reading-with-command-line/,"Crossposted tomy blog.Alison Booth and I are co-teaching a graduate course this semester on Digital Literary Studies. As a part of the course, we’re having a series of technical workshops - command line, Python, text analysis, encoding, and markup. The scheduling worked out such that these workshops wound up being on Wednesdays, with the discussions of critical theory on digital humanities and literary method mostly on Mondays. That’s all fine and good, but I worried that neatly dividing the class out in that way would create a divide between the one day of the week when the students were actively discussing the material in the course and the other when they were mostly in hands-on workshops. Rather than having a hacking day and a yacking day, I wanted to see what I could do to create an environment for hack-yacking. So when I taught the first workshop on command line, I wanted to try something slightly different from what I normally do by making more room for discussion.

Free Writing About Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/free-writing-about-pedagogy/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.We’re in the thick of our unit on teaching and learning inPraxis, where students discuss a range of teaching topics including buttonology, minimalist pedagogy, and critical digital pedagogy. As outcomes for the conversation we ask the students to produce two things:a minimalist, speculative digital humanities workshop on a topic of interest to them as a teach-to-learn activitya teaching statement that might intersect with their new thinking on digital pedagogyThe context for the two assignments is thatall DH involves teaching at some level. Graduate students rarely receive adequate training in teaching, and they often teach under very specific departmental constraints. The two activities are meant to give them experience thinking about a range of teaching possibilities that they might not otherwise get to experience.

On Tasks Large and Small,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/on-tasks-large-and-small/,"The biggest issue that I have faced with my work with the Praxis Program has to do with how I judge the difficulty of the tasks before me. I have proven to be singularly inadequate at distinguishing quick fixes with a large payoff from larger problems that would yield only small utility. This issue surfaced early on, when I boldly suggested that I could implementOmniauthin a week. Two and a half months later I am still trying to get it to work: the Omniauth code structure works more generally, but each authentication service is its own unique little snowflake, different from all the other snowflakes in the code breaking eccentricities that it brings to the table. We had to jettison Twitter early on because it would not return user emails, which are central to the way that Devise handles logins. Facebook worked on local rails servers, but something whacky is happening on staging (and in deployment, for that matter) so that it throws a redirect uri failure at us that did not appear befor...",2013-05-06T10:06:03-04:00,423

To that end, theSLabcrew asked us to make a list of our priorities forPrism. Hopefully this will help us make a to do list in the coming weeks. The following was the list that seemed to come out of yesterday’s meeting, though it’s possible that other people could have gotten different impressions from the conversation.These seem to be our priorities, in no particular order except roughly that in which they were brought up:Types of texts- we’re interested in opening up the Prism framework to deal with pictures, music, etc.Getting a crowd- we want to get a large group of people working with Prism, however that might be arranged.Visualizations- we’re interested in expanding Prism’s visualizations to allow you to see the individual set of markings in relation to the crowd and to let you see one marking category’s visualization beside another.User uploads- we want...",2013-02-01T06:52:33-05:00,368
Jekyll Tag Clouds,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/jekyll-tag-clouds/,"Crossposted toBrandon's Blog.Blogging more this summer has unsurprisingly meant that I have spent a lot of time on my blog. I noticed that the way I had my site generate category pages had stopped working at some point. I set the whole thing up so long ago that troubleshooting it was hard. My old way involved using a plugin to generate categories, which meant that I needed to host my Jekyll site separately from GitHub Pages. Searching around for other options eventually took me toLong Qian’s post on generating tags in Jekyll, which promised to do a similar approach but with vanilla Jekyll and liquid syntax.I got their approach working to replace my old system. My old use of categories was pretty restricted though–I had really only used them to create separate pages for my pedagogy, DH Now, and DH+Lib posts. But Quian’s post got me thinking about discovery and my blog archive, so I took things a step further and added just a couple tweaks to their post (based on aStack Overflow post the...",2023-06-26T00:00:00-04:00,368
Marking and Explanation in Prism,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/marking-and-explanation-in-prism-2/,"My first experience withPrismlast spring brought something of an existential crisis along with it, when I was asked to mark my belovedA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Manin terms of realism/modernism:He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.O, the wild rose blossomsOn the little green place.ConsideringPortraitas a modernist novel was nothing new, but being asked to consider individual words in that context was altogether unsettling. Words like “tuckoo” and “moocow” are easy to mark as modernist, but “baby” is perfectly reasonable within a realist text; it only begins to feel experimental as a part of the larger phrase “baby tuckoo.” And how do we account for the two lines of verse, where the words themselves are not particularly experimental but the juxtaposition between prose and poetry creates just the sort of genre bending you would expect from modernism?I think this very brief analysis tells us something very important about...",2012-10-01T11:08:17-04:00,423
Finding The Community After Twitter,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/finding-the-community-after-twitter/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.For years and like many in DH, Twitter was my main connection to the larger DH community, both to share my own work and to see what was going on in the field. I never felt that I was consistently active on the platform, but I had accumulated a modest following over the course of the last decade more by virtue of consistency than anything else. I was always convinced most of those were bots, but I did come to cherish the little cohort of DH regulars that interacted in that space. It was how I learned about the field, found jobs for students, and generally stayed connected.The platform has long been fraught, a wildly different experience depending on your identity and work. But things feel different now. This summer’s writing sprint coincided neatly with Twitter’s ongoing implosion due to Musk’s mismanagement (the platform became X since this post was first drafted). I’ve largely refrained from posting there for a few months as the ties between the app and fa...",2023-08-14T00:00:00-04:00,1271
Origin Story,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/origin-story/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Students often ask me during professional development conversations to talk about my own path that brought me to where I am today. I thought I would document a version of that narrative here in the spirit of the “Origin Stories” shared as a part of theSpeaking in Codeevent hosted by the Scholars’ Lab years ago. I found those narratives to be helpful as I was finding my own way, however contextual and idiosyncratic they might be. It’s hard to know where one might walk when the tracks aren’t always clear. Hopefully my own winding path will prove useful to someone else, even with all the caveats I note below about how dependent my own story is on circumstance, luck, and privilege. This post will be a little more detailed than the 1:1 conversations I have with students, and I’ll try to save reflections for the end.I was a big tech nerd growing up.

How to Build a DH Scene,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/how-to-build-a-dh-scene/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I’m in the middle of listening to an audiobook of David Byrne’sHow Music Works. The book is a fascinating glimpse into the music industry, but I almost had to pull my car over when he started talking about digital humanities centers.Okay–Byrne was actually in the middle of a whole chapter describing the special character of CBGB, the renowned music club that opened in 1973 and that was the frequent haunt of punk and new wave bands. But I was struck by just how resonant so much of his advice for cultivating a special and identifiable community was to me, someone who spends a lot of time working to do the same with students new to digital humanities. Once I parked, I quickly made some notes riffing on Byrne’s own eight characteristics of a successful music scene. I’ll share Byrne’s elements below and then riff on them as they relate to our own practice of cultivating collective DH experiences.

Getting from Here To There,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/getting-from-here-to-there/,"Crossposted tomy personal blog.A few weeks ago, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of theirnew graduate fellowshipfor students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the first of two posts sharing materials from the two events I took part in while there. I was asked to give a workshop on project development for graduate students as well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the workshop for students, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how to approach project planning and some activities for helping them think through their work for the year. I essentially tried to condense the greatest hits of thePraxis Programinto 90 minutes.

Jekyll Crossposting with Raketags,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/jekyll-crossposting-with-rake/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.If you’ve spent any time at all reading on my blog you’ve probably noticed that I crosspost virtually all my material to theScholars’ Labsite. There are good reasons for this: almost everything I do in one space is relevant to the other, and it’s way to drive traffic between the two places. It’s a bit of a pain though. While both sites are built with Jekyll, they live in two different repositories, two different folders on my computer. They also each have slightly different frontmatter. So my old workflow looked something like this:Compose and edit in my blog repository.Open a second window.Carefully copy and past everything from my original post into the identical post in the other site folder.Edit the front matter.Publish.Grumble the whole time.I use a rake task to automate the building of the initial post, which saves a little time by generating everything for my post templates.That command looks like this:desc ""Begin a new post in #{posts_dir}""

Counting To Seven,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/counting-to-seven/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.When working with students on DH pedagogy, one common question I get is how to run a classroom discussion. After all, some disciplines rely more on lecture-based approaches to instruction than conversation. Running a discussion can feel totally new for students unfamiliar to the format, especially so if the topic is DH-related. I wanted to share a short little trick you can use to ease into the format across topics and methods, including in DH.A lot of the anxiety new instructors feel about running discussions comes back to silence. Dead air can be terrifying–the exact moment when imposter syndrome will flare up. When you ask a question and no one responds the instinct might be to answer it yourself. But this loop can create a space in which one gestures towards a discussion without actually giving the students space to speak up. Instead of back and forth, you produce what is essentially a lecture with performative discussion elements. Sometimes you do need...",2023-06-12T00:00:00-04:00,387

To learn about Amanda’s workflow, prod her to finally publish a now-too-long post about DH and public speaking anxiety before 2020 ends…)Before you dive in, though, you may wish to read our October 2019 blog post“How We Talk and Write about DH Jobs”if you haven’t already. Well intentioned academic job advice can be and often is harmful—so in that post’s “Slightly Better Job Advice, Take Two” section, we discuss how we’re trying to share what we know about job searches in a way that affirms any readers as valued peers and scholars, just as they are.

Digital Humanities Pedagogy And Opportunities For Hope,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/digital-humanities-pedagogy-and-opportunities-for-hope/,"Crossposted tomy personal blog.In September, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of theirnew graduate fellowshipfor students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the second of two posts sharing materials from the events I took part in while there. I was asked to givea workshop on project development for graduate studentsas well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the open talk I gave, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how the Scholars’ Lab works with students. I write a talk for situations like these, but I try to avoid straight-up reading the text (more info on how I approach public speaking in DH available here). So what you will see below is more like a roadmap of the general gist of what we talked about. I did not consult the text too much in the moment. The only other relevant piece of framing that you will need is that I added the phrase “he works for the students”...",2019-10-17T00:00:00-04:00,5809
Digital Humanities And The Ellington Effect,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/digital-humanities-and-the-ellington-effect/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I’ve long admired Lisa Rhody’s post on whatdigital humanists can learn from improv comedy. Besides the excellent message that text conveys on collaboration (always ask how your contribution moves things forward), I always think of that piece as a model for how outside interests can inform the work that we do. For my own part, a lot of how I approach collaboration and digital humanities comes from the world of music. I’ve played in a variety of bands and musical contexts for at least twenty-five years, and my experience as a part of the Charlottesville jazz community especially has long shaped how I work with others. Jazz history is full of lessons for the prospective DHer (or really for any field).1I’ll focus today on what digital humanists can learn about collaboration and leadership from one the music’s most prominent bandleaders–Duke Ellington.Ellington’s long career as a director, composer, and arranger for jazz big band is a masterclass in how parts be...",2023-07-10T00:00:00-04:00,1140
We Data: An Icebreaking Activity,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/we-data-an-icebreaking-activity/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.This semester, I’m teaching an undergraduate course at UVA called “Data for the Rest of Us.” The course is, broadly, an attempt to introduce principles and practices of critical data literacy to students who might otherwise find full-blow data science intimidating. I’ve published thewhole course online, and I’ll likely be posting some reflections off and on as the course proceeds. The centerpiece of the course is the group construction of a dataset and associated narrative description based on their research interests, an outcome that I’m largely basing onResponsible Datasets in Context. Much more to say about the design of the course as a whole, but I wanted to document a little about the first day today. If RDiC is where the inspiration for the course came from, I’ve had the first day’s activity in my head just as long. I planned to introduce myself and the course in a few minutes before quickly shifting gears into something I called “We Data.” Here’s the...",2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00,893
Out on a (Small) Limb,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/out-on-a-small-limb/,"In writing the following post, I was struck by how close it felt to oneAlex Gilwrote last year about a similar Prism disaster that he called theherokulypse. Alex wrote his post on April 23 of last year, so we’re a few days ahead of schedule for apocalyptic project events.–Over the past few weeks the Praxers have been diligently working on their own pieces of Prism.GwenandCeciliahave been making strides with design,Chrishas worked on highlighting and now visualizing,Shanehas been doggedly attacking user uploads, and I worked on pieces of Omniauth, design, and uploads. On Monday we made our first attempt to really put things back together, and theresult was pretty horrific.My sense was that we had all broken Prism a little bit in our own special way. Some of these broken pieces weren’t really noticeable until we combined everything back together, when suddenly Prism became a big goopy mess.

From Gaming To Writing,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/from-gaming-to-writing/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Michael Levenson, my dissertation director, always had great ice breakers. I most remember one that opened a graduate class on Henry James and Joseph Conrad: “What do you read for?” Separate from research questions per se, this was an invitation to think about what made a passage pop to us, what was at the core of our interest in particular topics. I remember saying that I often found myself writing about problems, puzzles at the core of passages that didn’t make sense. A friend noted how he was drawn to conflict and politics. Another cited interpersonal relations as the thing that drew them in. I marveled at how rarely I thought about the foundational interests in my research areas. What is it that makes one put down the book and pick up the pen?For over two years now I’ve been writing forBacklog, “a video game newsletter for people who are behind on videogames.” Writing about a different subject for a public audience has been invigorating, not least becau...",2023-08-07T00:00:00-04:00,1020

Against Projecting: Planning DH Course Projects That Work For You,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/against-projecting-planning-dh-course-projects-that-work-for-you/,"Crossposted toBrandon's Blog.I was recently asked to give a workshop for theDigital Ethnic Futures Consortiumon how to manage the logistics for semester-long course projects. The result was something I came to call “Against Projecting: Planning DH Course Projects the Work for You.” The goal of it was to take that question and really get to the underlying pre-issues that, if ignored, can make things in the classroom much more difficult. That is to say - before we even get to the how of digital course projects we need to think through why we want to include them, what resources we have to support the work, and what shape they will take.Here’s the abstract:Many instructors include digital projects as the logical final assignments in digital humanities courses. Doing so introduces a host of challenges, however, and it can become all too easy to feel committed to the idea of the digital project in a way that overwhelms our course goals, our students, and ourselves.

Teaching With Big Ears,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/teaching-with-big-ears/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.When I studied music in school, we were all given a listening placement test. First, the graduate student in charge would play a series of melodies and harmonies for us, and we were asked to notate them. The second test exercised the inverse skills: given a sheet of music we were asked to sing what we saw in front of us. In each case, we were graded on how accurately we were able to convert sound to written notation and back again. All incoming music majors were slotted into one of six sections based on the results of our ear training test, and I placed into the bottom one. Even the most basic skill–pitch matching, or the ability to hear a note and sing that same note back–was a challenge for me. Twice a week for the rest of the semester, the students in my section filed into a basement classroom and made noise around a piano in what must have been an excruciating experience for the trained music doctoral student who taught us.Over the course of the year, t...",2020-08-19T05:39:34-04:00,1605
Prism in the Classroom: Questions to Frame Discussion,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/prism-in-the-classroom-questions-to-frame-discussion/,"Crossposted tomy personal website.I have been touting the use ofPrismin the university classroom for some time now, but a recent exchange withAnnie Swaffordsuggested to me that it might be worth explicitly outlining how I would go about doing so. With that in mind, I’ve composed the following set of questions for how I might frame discussion of Prism in the classroom. I’ve admittedly only had very brief chances to implement the tool in the classroom myself, so the thoughts come largely out of speculation and conversation. It should be noted as well that I assume below that you have already chosen a text and categories along which it should be marked (I may write on ways to approach such choices at a later date). In what follows, I move from general questions that I think would be helpful in framing any discussion of the tool to a particular use-case inJames Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

But I’ve always run into problems when it comes time to submit my CV as an actual document. Copying the page over to Microsoft Word brings in all the detritus of my web styling and structure, and I have to dutifully edit those elements out before submission.I described this problem to Jeremy Boggs, our Head of R&D, and he immediately suggested that I look into making a print stylesheet for my CV page.

What Drew Me to Digital Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/what-drew-me-to-digital-pedagogy/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.This year, I am working with Rachel Retica and Seanna Viechweg on a digital pedagogy reading group (join us!). Our plan is to run a yearlong series of sessions, rotating who is in charge of any one meeting, as a means of giving each of us practice teaching at the same time that we’re discussing it. My first session focused on digital pedagogy and labor. Rachel’s session will focus on reading, interpretation and information literacy, and Seanna will run her session as a discussion of culturally responsive pedagogy. As a part of this work, we’ll also be aiming to work up a collectively authored piece at the end of the year. As we’re still in the brainstorming phase now, we decided to take on a series of writing prompts to gather some raw material to discuss our own orientations to this work.Our first: what’s your origin story?It was hard for me to come up with a single answer to the question, so I opted for a kind of refracting approach.

Failure,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/failure/,"In middle school I built a website about the seven wonders of the ancient world. Nothing fancy – just images and some links – and I never published it. Building a personal website over the past few days as per Jeremy’s request feels a bit like coming full circle. My HTML skills remain prepubescent at best, and my barebones site keeps the spirit of GeoCities in the early 1990’s alive and well. Check it out.http://walshbr.com/old-site/.I admit to some hesitation in posting this fledgling site for all to see: so much more could be done to bring it into the twenty-first century.

I had presented with Mackenzie Brooks on open writing for Small Liberal Arts Colleges. My Facebook feed was full of photos of people voting in the US presidential election. Long lines. People putting one foot in front of another to vote. I flew back home on election night, and I remember the strange way that people in the airport started gathering around the television watching what was happening. Normally, people kept to themselves. That night, the anxiety in the air was palpable. As was the growing excitement (DLF, after all, was in Wisconsin that year). I remember the panic I felt flying and not knowing what would wait for me when we landed. When I got in my car and turned on NPR in a rush at 2:00 AM I first heard the results.

A Workflow For Remote Music Recording,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/a-workflow-for-remote-music-recording/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.If you’ve followed me on social media for any length of time you likely know that I am a musician. I play horns withThe Hard Modes, a group that performs original jazz arrangements of video game music. There’s some slight overlap between my time with that group and my work in the DH world, insofar as people in the DH community often tend to enjoy video game music (Quinn Dombrowski even had us perform for theAnimal Crossing: New Digital Humanitiesseries!). But the COVID-19 Pandemic and resultant social distancing the last few years really made the work feel more DH-y as we tried to find ways to keep playing together remotely even while it was unsafe to do so in person.

I adored this text that was recommended to me by Seanna Viechweg, one of our brilliant Praxis students this year. In it, Emdin advocates for bringing the authentic, lived experience of teachers and students into the classroom, especially when their identities depart from what might be considered academically acceptable. Emdin writes explicitly from his experiences teaching in urban classrooms, where he saw the conflict between teacherly norms that value whiteness and devalue disruptive, lived, or “ratchet” behaviors.

I think I am starting to get the hang of classes and understand their importance. The conversion process was nightmarish, but they allow you to be a lot more flexible when trying to include new tasks. Plus, I learned a lot from the ordeal.2) I made it so that you can now input your entire roster into the grading program and calculate all your final grades there. You only input the syllabus parameters once, at the beginning. The program saves these and then applies them to all the students on your list.

A Praxis-Oriented Introduction to Digital Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/a-praxis-oriented-introduction-to-digital-pedagogy/,"Crossposted tomy blog.One thing I’ve realized about the Praxis Program, our year-long, soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities for a cohort of doctoral students, is that it changes each year. In my first year here, these changes were a source of anxiety for me. Surely, I thought, there must be a way to systematize the program, to find a format that would be more consistent, and, thus, more sustainable. Over the last two years, however, I’ve come to view these regular tweaks as a strength of the program. Rather than being locked into what we’ve done in the past, we’re committed to re-examining our assumptions and our plans. To illustrate this, I’d like to share an example of a problem we identified and some the ways we tried to address it during the past year.At the end of every program, we run exit surveys with students and hold debrief conversations among the staff involved. Last year’s discussions brought up an important issue: for all of our talk about how the program is mea...",2019-05-30T11:25:22-04:00,2123
Praxis Hackathon Scaffolding,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/praxis-hackathon-scaffolding/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.The current formulation for Praxis has the students carrying out a small-scale hackathon in the spring as a way of practicing the variousintersecting pieces of the curriculumthey’ve learned throughout the year. The segment is meant to draw together lessons in project development, humanities programming, and critical approaches to design. We have a few moments in the year to scaffold the process leading to the hackathon and help the students come to a shared sense of their goals and activities for that time before the event itself. In describing how the process will work for the students, I proposed that we start with a working definition for digital projects.

I picked this kit because it comes with just about every component you need to get going, as opposed to some other models that provide you with a shopping list but leave you to do the ordering (these options wound up being much more expensive all told).

We actually started several months before this academic year began, and, as we close out another semester, I have been spending time thinking about just what has made it such an effective learning experience for me. I already had a technical background from my time in the Scholars’ Lab at the beginning of the process, but I had no experience with Python or NLP. Now I feel most comfortable with the former of any other programming language and familiar enough with the latter to experiment with it in my own work.The general mode of proceeding has been this: depending on schedules and deadlines, we meet once or twice every two weeks.

Maximalist Digital Humanities Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/maximalist-digital-humanities-pedagogy/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.One of my earliest teaching memories was of too much. I had gotten an example syllabus to consult as I prepared to teach my own course for the first time, and I remember being floored byso many policies, most of them required by my institution. Did my first learning encounter with the students have to be structured exclusively by rules? By so many pages of them? How was I supposed to find my way as a teacher–just one person–among so much?By contrast, less has paid dividends so often in my teaching career. Fewer readings, more conversation. Less technology, more time to develop literacy. Smaller scale, closer attention to the students in front of me. For me, thinking small always leads to impact–and a more sustainable classroom.

Now that I’m on the other side of the table and offeringthemmyself, I thought I would document how I run mock interviews in case the information is useful for others.The ProcessYou’ll first want to assemble 1-2 other interviewers for your mock committee. Part of the strangeness of interviews is the discomfort of managing a one-sided conversation. You’ll want to mirror that for students if you can.

Over the course of a few weeks, the students each drafted the materials they would need to deliver a low-tech workshop on a digital humanities method or concept relevant to their own interests. The unit gave the students the opportunity to explore their chosen topic in dialogue with one another as they felt their way through how they would go about teaching the material to a broader audien...",2019-06-27T08:59:53-04:00,1790

The curriculum is only one place in which teaching happens in higher education: every interaction is also a form of teaching, whether it pertains to a syllabus, a budget, or the use of campus space. In other words, the classroom is inseparable from the infrastructure that supports its work. The teach...",2025-03-10T00:00:00-04:00,1368

You can access a persistent version in MyBinderhere.The project began with the goal of keeping Brandon from reinventing the wheel when working on natural language processing projects. By collecting together common scripts and approaches for personal use, it served as a common reference point that would be easier to consult than searching back through older repositories on GitHub when presented with new iterations of old problems. Eventually and once Rebecca came onboard the project, we started documenting the methods with a more generalized audience in mind.The project is presented as a series of notebooks, a series of Python 3 recipes for common problems and issues associated with preparing data for text analysis and natural language processing.

Over the course of a year, these students develop and implement a digital project of their own design. The activity often works quite well while the conversation is theoretical, but we consistently noticed tensions in our fellowship cohorts once work on the project got underway and deadlines loomed.

Your Digital Life in 140 Characters,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/your-digital-life-in-140-characters/,"I just recently hopped on Twitter for the first time as part of a conference through UVA’sInstitute for the Humanities and Global Cultures. It was a bit rough for the first five or six tweets as I worked out the kinks. Here are some thoughts that came out of the experience.I am hooked on tweeting conference presentations. I was a bit worried that tweeting would be too distracting during a talk, but I actually found that it made me a better listener. I was forced to listen hard to find discernible takeaways, which helped me to digest the information being thrown at me. Also, it gave me a way to occupy my wandering attention in a productive way. Tweeting also seems like a good way to extend the life of the conference after the proceedings are complete.On that same note, the SLab crew has had a few conversations about how Twitter interacts with intellectual property. I felt obligated to assign many tweets I made to a particular person, assuming that I was giving credit where it was due. I...",2012-11-27T18:24:30-05:00,452

Music Genre and Spotify Metadata,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/music-genre-and-spotify-metadata/,"Crossposted tomy personal site.For the last couple weeks, I have been exploring APIs useful to sound studies for a sound recording and poetry project I am working on with former Scholars’ Lab fellowAnnie Swafford. I was especially drawn to playing around withSpotify, which has anAPIthat allows you to access metadata for the large catalog of music available through their service. The experiment described below focuses on genre: a notoriously messy category that we nonetheless rely on to tell us how to process the materials we read, view, or hear. Genre tells us what to expect from the art we take in, and our construction and reception of generic categories can tell us a lot about ourselves. In music, especially, genres and subgenres can activate fierce debates about authenticity and belonging. Does your favorite group qualify as “authentic” jazz? What composers do you have to know in order to think of yourself as a real classical music aficionado? Playing with an artist’s metadata can e...",2015-09-21T06:48:25-04:00,1286
The Direction of Prism,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/the-direction-of-prism/,"This week, the team has been throwing around a number of ideas as to how we can further develop Prism. I keep falling back on spatial metaphors to categorize the changes currently in play. I threw the following model onto the SLab white board, wherein I propose two types of changes: vertical and horizontal.First, the vertical axis, those changes which work within the tool’s existing functionality. Some changes deepen a function already in place. The suggestions offered by last year’s team for other visualizations would fall into this category. A new visualization can offer a more dynamic interaction with a set of markings, but users are still engaging with the same dataset. The fundamental function of the tool would remain the same. These sorts of vertical changes offer a deeper, more robust mode of interaction with the operations that the tool can already carry out.I oppose these to horizontal changes, which more fundamentally alter the number and types of things that a tool can do.

During the pandemic I experienced a series of personal and professional challenges that caused me to slow things down considerably across the board. The result was that my writing schedule ceased–I simply did not have the energy to blog on top of other things. This past summer I set a goal for myself to post once per week as a means of trying to force myself back into a blogging mindset.I managed to stick to that rough schedule, partially due to a concentrated sprint early in the summer that gave me a backlog of posts I could use downstream. Now, at the end, I am surprised to find that things cohere more than expected.

The Shape Of DH Work,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/the-shape-of-dh-work/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Several years ago I wrote a blog post entitled “What is Praxis Working on?” The TL; DR of that post was that I regularly have people approach me (students included!) to ask what the current cohort ofPraxis–our project-based introduction to digital humanities–is currently doing. Typically, that question is a shorthand for asking after thebig, branded final projectfor the program. In that post, I argued that such questions miss the point: the digital projects our students take on have always been a means to an end to give the students space to practice, but the real projects are the students themselves. And we’re really working on being better for them.Over the years, we’ve revised the program in a range of ways. We’ve become more systematic about the topics and workshops we offer, coalescing around a more intentionalcurriculum. Realizing that for all of our teacherly ambitions we did not discuss pedagogy very much in the program, we implemented apedagogy uni...",2023-07-03T00:00:00-04:00,1922

And as I’ve gotten older and busier, I’ve had more and more need to find ways to keep up with work while taking care of other things. In the last six months I’ve started to do a deep dive into the DH resources out there available as audio, things that I can absorb during the cracks of the day. In the hopes of finding more, I posted to Mastodon asking if anyone had favorite recordings of DH talks, lectures, or workshops. The post got a fair amount of recirculation but few actual replies with links. That tells me there might be others interested in such materials, so I thought I would start a little running list of what I’ve been checking out and share it out.

As a part of this section of the year, our students’ task is to design a lightweight, speculative workshop that introduces a DH concept of interest to them. The activity is a teach-to-learn one with some constraints: in an effort to movebeyond buttonologyapproaches to teaching technical topics, the students are meant to think through how pencil and paper, low-tech, or otherwise minimal ways of teaching might empower themselves and their students to learn material that might otherwise feel beyond them.At this point in the semester the fellows have just begun their thinking.

Questions to Ask When Applying,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/questions-to-ask-when-applying/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.This post is primarily meant to be a resource for students interested in applying to one of the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowships. I often speak with people 1:1 about their applications to our Praxis or DH Fellows programs. These solo meetings are usually the best way to get to know someone and learn about their work, and I hope students will continue reaching out in this way. But I also always want the process to be transparent for everyone applying, and I want every applicant to have access to the same resources. So in what follows I try to collect the most useful information about how to apply successfully for one of our programs based on what repeatedly comes up in those conversations and at our information sessions (directly pulled from one piece of that slide deck). We always have more strong applicants than we can take into our programs, and asking the following questions of your application can help you to ensure you’re representing yourself in the...",2023-05-30T00:00:00-04:00,2126

Is It Data?,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/is-it-data/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Snow is on the ground, but I bundled up to make it to campus for week two of “Data for the Rest of Us,” a semester-long, two-credit introduction to data literacy from a humanities perspective. The general arc of the course takes students through all parts of the data construction pipeline and culminates in small groups developing datasets based around their own interests to share back with the class. This week’s topic was “Data Identification,” which I structured in two segments: theory and practice.First, we developed a working definition of what qualifies as data. Core to this was theWikipedia page for data, which offers a neat and actionable summary in the first paragraph: “Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, US also /ˈdætə/ DAT-ə) are a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.”For our p...",2025-01-22T00:00:00-05:00,934
"Reading, Not Writing",https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/reading-not-writing/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Back in January, we in the Scholars’ Lablooked back fondlyon all the public writing we had done together in 2019 and boldly looked ahead to all that we would do in 2020. We had big plans for putting more thoughts out in the world on a variety of topics. Then, of course, 2020 happened. In addition to the ongoing public health emergency, I have also been simmering with bottled rage about the full spectrum of political struggles related to the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, the ongoing climate emergency, and the Presidential election. Writing seems far less important now, with everything going on. All of this is to say that I, for one, have not been getting much blogging done. I felt a tremendous amount of guilt around this at first, as one typically does in academia when you have publicly declared yourself to be doing something that you cannot follow through on. But I have been trying to take the advice of Connor Kenaston, a former Praxis stu...",2020-10-19T06:39:37-04:00,1187

Personal Data Story,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/personal-data-story/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I just gave a workshop online for Dr.Jennifer Isasi’s course at Pennsylvania State University. Normally I would share the text I used for events like these, but since it was a workshop I don’t quite have something formal to share in that mode. The abstract and title I provided for the event can give some flavor of things:Organized Chaos: Humanities Data and Cleaning with a PurposeThis workshop covers the theory and practice of preparing humanities data for analysis. Even while being notoriously difficult to work with, we will explore how the mess of humanities data is actually what conveys a wealth of information. We will discuss the affordances and tradeoffs inherent in data cleaning with the humanities, when it is worth doing, and when it is worth maintaining a sense of organized chaos that our materials demand. Practical discussions will include working with dates, irregular spellings, and data organization. We will use OpenRefine to practice working wit...",2025-03-24T00:00:00-04:00,1371
Omniauth,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/omniauth/,"After several weeks of grinding away with the generous help ofEricandShane, Omniauth works with our current setup. Now a user can arrive at our site and log into the system using their Facebook or Google accounts as an alternative to creating their own Prism-specific login.One significant difficulty we encountered was how to handle multiple authentications. In the default framework, the system creates a new user when you authenticate through a service. So, if a user clicks on Facebook authentication, that action creates a new user in the database. If that same user comes back and clicks Twitter instead, that user will then have a separate account unlinked to the first in the database. Rather than implement an authentication management system, we decided to add a disclaimer to the myPrisms page directing users to login with the correct accounts if they aren’t seeing the information that they expect.Another difficulty: initially we also wanted to include Twitter authentication, but Twitt...",2013-04-02T07:46:22-04:00,285
Embedded Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/embedded-pedagogy/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. You can find book-related postshere. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email atbmw9t@virginia.edu.This is a book about teachers, the labor they take on, and the structures that prevent them doing that work well. Our institutions often define teaching as something that happens in specific spaces, at specific times, and by specific people. In higher education, positions are often described with a common shorthand: “I teach a 2-2” or “I carry a 4-4.” The formulation describes both a calendar distribution as well as the supposed burde...",2025-02-14T00:00:00-05:00,1591
Discussion that Opens,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/discussion-that-opens/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I was always very quiet in coursework as a student. I have always had some measure of social anxiety, and I felt it especially acutely when pressured to participate in the service of a grade. This was a constant in every course I took except one: in graduate school I took a course with David Vander Meulen on textual editing, and I felt more engaged and free to do so than ever before or after. While David was an exceptional teacher, there were other specific reasons I credit with the vibe in the room: it was a three hour seminar and there were only four students in the room. I could not hide and, perhaps most importantly, in a group that small there was a real sense that we were in it together, that we were accountable to each other for keeping the conversation alive. The social anxiety persisted after the course, but I’ve always remembered that group dynamic fondly.Did I mention the course met Friday mornings at 8:00AM? We really depended on each other to s...",2024-08-30T00:00:00-04:00,975

Year Of Book Blogging: Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/year-of-book-blogging-digital-humanities-pedagogy-in-kind/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.Amanda, Ammon, and I have been discussing our plans for the upcoming year of blogging. While last year’s blogging push was invigorating and exciting, we wanted things to be slightly different in the coming year. In particular, we’ve been talking about wanting more continuity in the things we publish. Speaking for myself, it often felt like I was blogging just in time and on deadline. Some good things came out of that work, but I liked the idea of putting just a little more thinking into the project ahead of time so that I could blog around a central topic for the year. Amanda and Ammon have been incredibly helpful in talking about all this with me.Truthfully, I’ve been feeling the lack of a large writing project lately. After mydissertation, I worked on atext analysis coursebookwith Sarah Horowitz, a faculty colleague at W&L. I adore blogging, but I feel the lure of a large project I can chip away at over the next year and that can draw together my energy. ...",2020-01-28T04:28:28-05:00,1632
Thirteen Oblique Strategies For Digital Pedagogy,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/thirteen-oblique-strategies-for-digital-pedagogy/,"Crossposted tomy blog.When I sat down to write this post I had no ideas. That’s probably inevitable, given the year of blogging challenge that we’re undertaking in the Scholars’ Lab. The whole point is to write often and frequently, that there is value in a steady stream of thoughts rather than waiting for the perfect blog post, and that regular writing makes the whole thing easier. Still, all those good intentions didn’t help me as I struggled to put text to blank page. As I often do in those situations I got out a deck of cards and started playing.I’ve been obsessed withOblique Strategiesfor years now. If you’re not familiar,Oblique Strategiesis a deck of cards published by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that aims to offer short, pithy suggestions for getting around creative dilemmas. The idea behind them is that the serendipity of drawing a mysterious phrase from the deck will help disrupt any blocks you might have moving forward.

Your Budget Is a Question of Pedagogy and Equity,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/your-budget-is-a-question-of-pedagogy-and-equity/,"Crossposted toBrandon's blog.I finished drafting this post back before the extent of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming known. And now, of course, the impact of the virus around the globe—and on higher education in particular—continues to evolve. So I had been sitting on this post for some time; I wasn’t sure how a rapidly changing landscape of higher education, replete with hiring freezes and bleak budgetary outlooks, might impact these conversations. I’m still uncertain. But I’m publishing this now in the expectation that ethical conversations about budgets as they pertain to students and teaching are likely to become more important now than ever. I’m grateful toMackenzie Brooks,Amanda Visconti, and Elizabeth Fox for reading the post over.Caveats aside—this post is part of a larger project I’m working on over the course of the year about the intersections of digital humanities pedagogy as it can reflect and enact infrastructural change in higher education.

"Virginia Woolf, Natural Language Processing, and the Quotation Mark",https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/virginia-woolf-natural-language-processing-and-the-quotation-mark/,"Crossposted tomy personal blog.For my fellowship in the Scholars’ Lab this year I’ll be working withEricto expand a project we began last year on Virginia Woolf and natural language processing. My dissertation focuses on sound recordings and modernism, and this year I will focus on how Woolf’s quotation marks offer evidence of her engagement with sound as a textual device. In my reading, the quotation mark is the most obvious point at which sound meets text, the most heavily used sound recording technology in use by writers. Patterns in quotation mark usage across large corpora can tell us a lot about the role that sound plays in literature, but, as you might expect, there arelotsof quotation marks - hundreds or thousands in any given text. Computational methods can help us make sense of the vast number and turn them into reasonable objects of study.You can find more information inthis postabout my thinking on quotation marks and some preliminary results from thinking about them in rel...",2015-09-10T07:19:52-04:00,773
Grading in Ruby,https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/grading-in-ruby/,"Chrisrecently posted hisvery exciting experimentthat uses Ruby to create music theory worksheets for his students. Inspired by this, I have been playing around on Ruby with much more modest aims: I wanted to use Ruby to do my grading for me. I always do my grading with an Excel spreadsheet and a series of formulas. I am not particularly skilled at that interface, though, and it usually takes me a while to get it to work right. I thought I might as well try to do the same thing in Ruby. Admittedly, this idea also came from Chris: he has been claiming that such a thing was a very real possibility for weeks now.Here is the source code. It’s a fairly rudimentary interface at this point, but it does seem to work. It allows you to compute a student’s final grade in a course where assignment types are weighted differently.I hope to keep tinkering with this over time. Some things that I would want to include in later versions:1)Clean up the code.I don’t feel very comfortable with classes at th...",2012-12-10T05:57:34-05:00,450
